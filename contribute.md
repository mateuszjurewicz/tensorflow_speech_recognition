# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Separate PRs that make changes to the preprocessing notebooks and ones that
 improve the model training code
- When necessary, provide download links to the data preprocessed through the
 changed pipeline so that model training scripts can be easily tested on it.
- Describe the local setup on which you've tested your improvements
- If relevant, provide the rationale behind your changes

Thank you for your suggestions!
