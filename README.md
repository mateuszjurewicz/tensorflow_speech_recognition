# Tensorflow Speech Recognition
A complete walk-through on how to train deep learning models for Google Brain's 
Tensorflow Speech Recognition challenge on[Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge "Kaggle & Google Brain's Speech Recognition Challenge site")

Consists of jupyter notebooks that can be sequentially run on the raw data 
provided by the creators of the challenge, as well as both **keras** and 
**tensorflow** scripts to train convolutional models on the preprocessed data.

This includes:

2) Data investigation and visualization
3) Preprocessing and data augmentation
4) Model experiments on a small sample set
